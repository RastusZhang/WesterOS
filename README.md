## **Motive**

Computers are _weird_. Weird in the sense that they feel magical if you don't 
know how they work. If, and when, you start learning how it works, that magical
feeling fades away. You will either end up with "Wow! This is brillaint" or 
"Wow... this is shit."

So, you have basically _two_ options:

* **Take the blue pill:** Continue using the computer like normal. Magical feeling!
* **Take the red pill:** Go on a learning frenzy. _Risk of ending up as mad men +45%_

In case it wasn't obvious yet, I _took_ the latter.

Basically, I wanted to learn more about "computers". Working on the relatively 
high-level software is pretty fun, but I have a bad habit of ending up looking
at low-level internels and workings of stuff.

> Let's check it's implementation.. Oh, what's `VMA`? What's a `MMU`? What's a
> `TLB`?? What's a `TCR` and a `MAIR`??? Why am I here.. Just to suffer..?"

There was these layers of **abstraction** that I had no idea of! I should've
stopped there, but no. Instead, I said: "Okay. I really like the _call-of-the-void_
feeling of low-level stuff. Let's go wild and try to learn all the abstractions
by writing a 'simple' operating system. What could go wrong?" And now, here I am.

## **WesterOS**

Work-in-progress hobbyist operating system based on MIT's xv6[^1]. The name is 
from the most political & messed-up continent in the world of Game of Thrones.[^2]
I really like GoT (yeah, judge me all you want) and the political messiness of it
felt similar to my own goals with this project. _Everything is all over the place
and nothing makes sense._

This project exists only to help _me_ learn about operating systems and to have
some fun along the way. I don't claim to know much about _OS_ development. So,
the practices, design chocies and some implementations you see here WILL scare
you.

## **Features**

* ARM64 kernel /w pre-emptive multithreading (Based on xv6)
* Unix-like syscalls (Based on xv6)
* `/dev` andÂ `/proc` filesystems
* Virtual Memory Management (Based on xv6)
* 2-Level page tables /w 4K size
* CLI based interface (Based on xv6)
* Simple userland programs (Based on xv6)
* Terminal games (?)

## **Overview**

Let's dive a bit more into inner working of things. The target machine is 
_very specific & static_. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible by supporting
only the ARM64 architecture (ARMv8) and QEMU's ARM Virt machine.

Here's the target machine.

!['Hardware' Specs and QEMU Config](Media/Hardware_w_QEMU.png "Hardware & QEMU")

Only the must _basic_ peripherals are defined. Sadly, this means no USB, NVME and
NIC. :( Maybe in the future?

Here's the peripherals that I _plan_ to support.

* [ARM PrimeCell RTC PL031](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0224/)
* [ARM PrimeCell UART PL011](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/)
* [ARM PrimeCell GPIO PL061](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0190/)
* [QEMU RAM FrameBuffer (?)](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/hw/display/ramfb.c)
